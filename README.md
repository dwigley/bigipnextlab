Welcome to the most basic of BIG-IP Next 20.x labs. We are creating a few scenarios to show off some of the BIG-IP Next 20.x changes. 

Lab 1: The one that works (mostly). 
- Refer to the Rapidlab screenshot to create a BIG-IP Next lab consisting of 1 Central Manager instance and 2 LTM instances.
- Once the lab is available, log into the Central Manager. Ensure your LTMs were automatically added as a high availability pair.
- Use the application import tool to import the UCS file in the lab, making use of the included masterkey as well.
